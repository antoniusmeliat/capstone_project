# capstone_project
The capstone project is a crucial part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence programme. It is a significant undertaking and spans multiple modules and is designed to help you apply the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.

Here's a brief overview:
Stage 1: Begins in Module 3 and continues through Module 9. This phase allows stidents to experiment and test ideas with guided exercises, helping them strengthen their understanding of machine learning methods. It's an opportunity to explore a problem or dataset of your choosing.
Stage 2: Starts with Module 12 and is more structured. Students work towards developing a fully documented algorithm and model.
The project is continuous, with required components in different modules. By the end of the programme, students have created a portfolio-worthy artefact.
