# capstone_project
The capstone project is a crucial part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence programme. It is a significant undertaking and spans multiple modules and is designed to help students apply the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.

In stage 1 of this project students experiment and test ideas with guided exercises, helping them strengthen their understanding of machine learning methods. It's an opportunity to explore a chosen problem or dataset. Stage 2 is more structured - students work towards developing a fully documented algorithm and model. The project is continuous, with required components in different modules. By the end of the programme, students would have created a portfolio-worthy artefact.
