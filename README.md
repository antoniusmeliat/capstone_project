# capstone_project
The capstone project is a crucial part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence programme. It is a significant undertaking and spans multiple modules and is designed to help students apply the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.

In stage 1 of this project students experiment and test ideas with guided exercises, helping them strengthen their understanding of machine learning methods. It's an opportunity to explore a chosen problem or dataset. Stage 2 is more structured - students work towards developing a fully documented algorithm and model. The project is continuous, with required components in different modules. By the end of the programme, students would have created a portfolio-worthy artefact.

This project will focus on work or task allocation and explores the use of machine learning to optimize task allocation based on workforce skills, experience, and availability. Inspired by real-world challenges and Kaggle competitions, the goal is to build robust models that improve operational efficiency.

## Timeline
The project follows a structured 10-week execution plan:

- Week-by-Week Plan
- Week 1 (6–8 hours): Define project scope, success criteria and select dataset/tools (e.g., Python, scikit-learn). Milestone: Scope and dataset finalized.
- Week 2 (8–10 hours): Explore dataset for missing values, distributions and data types. Milestone: Initial data understanding documented.
- Week 3 (8–10 hours): Clean data, encode categorical variables, normalize features and split into training/testing sets. Milestone: Pre-processed dataset ready.
- Week 4 (6–8 hours): Engineer new features and apply dimensionality reduction if needed. Milestone: Feature set finalised.
- Week 5 (8–10 hours): Train simple models to establish baseline performance. Milestone: Baseline model performance established.
- Week 6 (8–10 hours): Compare models using cross-validation to identify the best candidate. Milestone: Best-performing model selected.
- Week 7 (10–12 hours): Select and apply methods to optimise model parameters. Milestone: Tuned model ready for final testing.
- Week 8 (8–10 hours): Select and apply metrics for assessing performance. Milestone: Final model evaluation completed.
- Week 9 (10–12 hours): Document methodology, create visualizations and interpret results. Milestone: First draft of documentation completed.
- Week 10 (8–10 hours): Finalise report and presentation materials. Milestone: Project submitted and ready for review.

## Methodology
Key strategies include:
- Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Model Combination: Use ensemble techniques inspired by the Netflix Prize to improve generalization.
- Cross-Validation: Consider time-based splits and class balance for robust evaluation.
- Optimisation: Reduce overfitting by adjusting batch sizes and learning rates.
- Interpretability: Explore the use of tools to explain predictions and visualize feature importance.
- Robust Testing: Evaluate model under noisy or incomplete inputs and synthetic data.
- Tracking Progress: Maintain logs, use Git for version control and tools for experiment tracking.
- Model Decisions: Switch models if performance gaps persist or refine based on error patterns.

## Collaboration & Feedback
- Peer Collaboration: Share insights and critique approaches with peers.
- Office Hour Check-ins: Schedule regular meetings to discuss progress and challenges.
- Online Forums: Use Kaggle and Stack Overflow for diverse input.
- Feedback Logs: Record feedback and actions taken to improve reflective practice.

## Risk Management
- Challenges: Overfitting, time constraints, tuning failures, data quality issues and technical errors.
- Mitigation Strategies: 
- Use cross-validation early.
- Stick to milestones and time-box tasks.
- Start with broad tuning ranges and refine.
- Conduct thorough data exploration and preprocessing.
- Use Git and backups to prevent data loss.
- In addition the following approach to tracking progress have been identified:
- Maintain a weekly checklist of tasks and milestones.
- Log model configurations and metrics.
- Use Git branches for experiments.
- Reflect weekly to adjust plans and update risk register.

## GitHub Portfolio Strategy
- To showcase the capstone project and attract attention from recruiters or collaborators, the following approach will be used for releasing and structuring the project on GitHub: 
- Use of repository https://github.com/antoniusmeliat/capstone_project already shown on LinkedIn
- Files organisation into folders: /data, /notebooks, /scripts, /results, /docs.
- Use GitHub Pages/Wiki for polished presentation.
- Structure code modularly with reusable functions and classes.
- Use of inline comments.
- Use of visuals (e.g. confusion matrices) and link to LinkedIn or portfolio to highlight achievements.
